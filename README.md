# Easy Split Project

We developed this mobile app in a week as a final project for our class in Development & Implementation of Mobile Apps.

## Final Project Guidelines

- The app should be built using ionic.  
- It needs to include at least two views.  
- The UI should contain different elements we have been working with on our sessions
(checkboxes, inputs, buttons, radio buttons, etc).  
- The app needs to connect to an API.   
- The app should access to the camera or GPS location.  

### To run the app in emulator

Move into 'easy_split_app' directory in terminal and run the following command:
```sh
ionic cordova run android
```

### To run the app in browser

Move into 'easy_split_app' directory in terminal and run the following command:
```sh
ionic serve
```
Access the app through http://localhost:8100/

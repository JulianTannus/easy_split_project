# Easy Split Project

## Final Project Guidelines

- The app should be built using ionic.  
- It needs to include at least two views.  
- The UI should contain different elements we have been working with on our sessions
(checkboxes, inputs, buttons, radio buttons, etc).  
- The app needs to connect to an API. Please, be prepare for next monday to tell me
which kind of information you will like to display and I will provide you with a simple API.   
- The app should access to the camera or GPS location ( I will explain it to you during this week).  
- Each group will deliver a unique app.  

### Run the app

Move into 'easy_split_app' directory in terminal and run the following command:
```sh
ionic serve
```
Access the app through http://localhost:8100/
